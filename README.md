# Developer Foundations

Revision: 2026-01-02

This repository provides every developer with a solid knowledge baseline—materials and guidance to help you improve your skills and grow as a developer.

## How to work with this repository?

The repository works as a workbook. It asks you the right questions about important topics and our tech stack because asking the right questions is more important than having all the answers. You learn by doing research and writing down your findings.

You can choose any topic to start with, switch between topics freely, and work at your own pace. There's no strict order—follow your curiosity or project needs.

We encourage you to use an AI agent to discuss the topics and find answers to the questions. However, we suggest you write down the answers yourself rather than copy-pasting AI-generated text or having the agent write the answers for you.

If you use VS Code with Copilot, the repository contains a custom Agent mode **Learning Assistant** with instructions to help you work through the workbook and maximize the learning experience.

If you are not using VS Code, check out [Learning Assistant.agent.md](./projects/Learning%20Assistant.agent.md) as an inspiration to create a similar agent in your AI tool of choice or configure prompt in ChatGPT or other chat-based AI.

**Since this should be solo work, fork this repository to your own GitLab personal space and work on it there.** From time to time, try to pull the latest changes from the main repository to your fork. If you don't know how to do that, it should be the first thing you learn. It's best to add the original repository as an alternative Git remote and pull changes from there.

If you are not sure about anything or need help, feel free to reach out to your colleagues.

## Let's get started!

1. Read the topics you should know as a developer in the `TOPICS.md` file.
2. Pick a topic you want to start with and open the corresponding file in the `workbook` folder.
3. Start your research and write down your findings and answers to the questions in the workbook file. Use the AI agent `Learning Assistant` to help you discuss the topics and find answers, but write down the answers by yourself.
4. Once you finish, you can discuss your answers with your colleagues or mentor to get feedback and improve your understanding.
5. Once done, mark the topic as completed in the `TOPICS.md` file.

## Projects

In the `projects` folder, you can find small projects that you can build to practice your skills. Each project contains a description of what to build and which topics it covers. You can use these projects to reinforce your learning and gain practical experience. Each project is designed to be doable over a weekend.

**Happy learning and coding!**
