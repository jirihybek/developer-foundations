# Topics You Should Know as a Developer

**How to use this checklist:**
- Check off topics as you learn them by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`.
- A checked topic means you understand the concept and can explain it.
- Use the workbook questions to guide your learning for each topic.
- Don't rush - focus on truly understanding each topic.
